# 📈 Amazon Stock Price Forecasting using ARIMA and ARIMAX

This project uses classical time series models — **ARIMA** and **ARIMAX** — to forecast the closing stock prices of **Amazon Inc.**, integrating **Google Trends** as an exogenous variable in the ARIMAX model.

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Predict Amazon's daily closing stock price.
- Compare ARIMA (univariate) and ARIMAX (multivariate with Google Trends).
- Evaluate the impact of exogenous variables (public interest) on financial forecasting.

---

## 📂 Data Sources

- **Amazon Stock Data**: Downloaded from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- **Google Trends**: Retrieved from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/) for the keyword _"Amazon"_
